# Signal processing

An accelerometer measures engine vibrations. By analysing the **vibration data** we can infer whether it is ACTIVE, IDLE or OFF, and also test and diagnose machine faults.
The egines are that of excavators, wheeled-loaders, dump trucks etc.

**Note**:

IDLE -> engine is running but the vehicle is not moving.

ACTIVE -> engine is running and the vehicle is moving.

OFF -> engine is off
